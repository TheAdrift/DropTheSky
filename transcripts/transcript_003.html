		<p>One panel. ZÃ¶e gazes through the glass cockpit at the planet,
		her fingers seeming to touch it, bathed in reflected light.</p>
		
		<p>Narration: <br />
		An upswelling affection for the place, the people in it: for friends,
		 lovers, and fondly held rivals; for family and nursed bruises.<br />
		Every tingle of this surging oceanic feeling that traced her spine,
		 she felt through emulated ganglia, reported to her prosthesis.<br />
		The desire to - if only she could! - enfold the globe and be held in return.<br />
		Tempered somewhat by the knowlege that this world was too big for
		 her, and she for it.<br />
		An unworkable arrangement, and yet: Home.<br />
		The place she was born.<br />
